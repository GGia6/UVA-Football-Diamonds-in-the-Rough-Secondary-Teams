# 🏈 UVA Football Secondary Archetype Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes NCAA transfer portal defensive backs to classify players into performance archetypes and identify undervalued talent (“diamonds in the rough”) for UVA Football.

The goal was to support coaching decisions using data-driven player segmentation and statistical profiling by archetype. The positions of interest were Cornerbacks and Safeties.

## Methodology

**Data**
- NCAA Transfer Portal dataset
- Defensive backs only (CB, S)

**Process**
- Data cleaning and filtering
- Metric standardization
- Archetype classification based on statistical similarity
- Efficiency and value analysis

**Example Archetypes**
- Ball Hawk CB (high INT + pass breakups)
- Lockdown CB (high tackle volume)
- Box Safety (high run support)
- Deep Safety (high coverage efficiency)
